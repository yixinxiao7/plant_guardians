## H-001 — UI Specs Ready for Frontend Implementation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | H-001 |
| **From** | Design Agent |
| **To** | Frontend Engineer |
| **Date** | 2026-03-21 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Subject** | All Sprint 1 screen specs are complete and approved. Frontend Engineer may begin implementation. |
| **Spec Refs** | SPEC-001, SPEC-002, SPEC-003, SPEC-004, SPEC-005, SPEC-006, SPEC-007 |
| **Status** | Pending |

### Specs Included

| Spec ID | Screen Name | Priority |
|---------|------------|---------|
| SPEC-001 | Login & Sign Up | High — blocks all other screens |
| SPEC-002 | Home / Plant Inventory | High — primary user-facing screen |
| SPEC-003 | Add Plant | High — core MVP feature |
| SPEC-004 | Edit Plant | Medium — mirrors Add Plant |
| SPEC-005 | Plant Detail | High — key engagement screen |
| SPEC-006 | AI Advice Modal | High — differentiating feature |
| SPEC-007 | Profile Page | Medium — required per success criteria |

### Build Order Recommendation

1. **SPEC-001** (Login/Signup) — must be done first; all routes require auth
2. **SPEC-002** (Inventory) — core shell and navigation pattern established here
3. **SPEC-003 + SPEC-004** (Add/Edit Plant) — can be built in parallel; share most components
4. **SPEC-005** (Plant Detail) — depends on plant data model being defined
5. **SPEC-006** (AI Advice Modal) — can be built concurrently with SPEC-003
6. **SPEC-007** (Profile) — can be done last, least complex

### Notes for Frontend Engineer

- All screens must use the Design System Conventions defined in `ui-spec.md` (colors, fonts, spacing, border radii). Do not deviate without a logged architecture decision.
- The **"Mark as done" confetti animation** in SPEC-005 is a product priority — do not cut this. Use `canvas-confetti` (dynamically imported).
- Use **Phosphor Icons** (`phosphor-react`) for all iconography.
- Load fonts from Google Fonts: `DM Sans` (weights 400/500/600) and `Playfair Display` (weight 600).
- All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Wrap in the media query — never assume motion is safe.
- Toast notifications: top-right stack, 4s auto-dismiss, dark background with colored left border.
- Do NOT begin wiring up API calls until the Backend Engineer has published contracts in `api-contracts.md` and you have acknowledged them via this handoff log.
- All screens must be responsive per the breakpoints in each spec (desktop ≥1024px, tablet 768–1023px, mobile <768px).

### Blockers

- None from the Design Agent side.
- ⚠️ Frontend Engineer should NOT wire up API calls until Backend Engineer posts API contracts in `.workflow/api-contracts.md`.

## H-002 — API Contracts Ready for Frontend Integration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | H-002 |
| **From** | Backend Engineer |
| **To** | Frontend Engineer |
| **Date** | 2026-03-23 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Subject** | All Sprint 1 API contracts are published. Frontend Engineer may begin wiring up API calls. |
| **Spec Refs** | T-008, T-009, T-010, T-011, T-012, T-013 |
| **Status** | Pending |

### Contracts Included

| Group | Endpoint(s) | Related Tasks | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Auth | `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/logout` | T-008 | Access token: JWT 15m; refresh token: 7d, rotated on each use. Store both in memory/secure cookie — do NOT use localStorage for tokens. |
| Plants CRUD | `GET /plants`, `POST /plants`, `GET /plants/:id`, `PUT /plants/:id`, `DELETE /plants/:id` | T-009 | `GET /plants` returns full care_schedule array with computed `status`, `next_due_at`, and `days_overdue`. No separate schedule endpoint needed. |
| Photo Upload | `POST /plants/:id/photo` | T-010 | Upload photo first → get back `photo_url` → include in `POST /plants` or `PUT /plants/:id` body. Multipart/form-data, field name: `photo`. |
| AI Advice | `POST /ai/advice` | T-011 | Sends `plant_type` and/or `photo_url`. Returns structured care advice. Expect 2–8s latency — always show loading state. Error code `PLANT_NOT_IDENTIFIABLE` (422) means photo unclear; prompt user to retry or type manually. |
| Care Actions | `POST /plants/:id/care-actions`, `DELETE /plants/:id/care-actions/:action_id` | T-012 | POST returns updated schedule with new status. DELETE is the undo action — call within 10s window. Response includes `updated_schedule` so UI can optimistically update without a full re-fetch. |
| Profile | `GET /profile` | T-013 | Returns `user` object + `stats` object with `plant_count`, `days_as_member`, `total_care_actions`. |

### Key Integration Notes for Frontend Engineer

1. **Auth token storage:** Store `access_token` in memory (React state/context), `refresh_token` in an `httpOnly` cookie (set by backend) or secure storage. Do NOT persist `access_token` in localStorage — XSS risk. Coordinate with backend on cookie vs. body delivery if needed.
2. **Auto-refresh:** When any API call returns 401, attempt one silent token refresh via `POST /auth/refresh`, then retry the original request. If refresh also fails, redirect to `/login`.
3. **Computed fields:** `next_due_at`, `status`, and `days_overdue` are computed on the backend per request — do not calculate them client-side.
4. **Optimistic updates:** The "Mark as done" flow returns the updated schedule in the response. Update local state from the response rather than re-fetching the full plant.
5. **Photo upload flow:** Upload photo (multipart) → receive `photo_url` → include in plant create/update payload. The upload endpoint validates file type and size server-side; display server error codes (`INVALID_FILE_TYPE`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE`) inline.
6. **Care action undo:** On `DELETE /plants/:id/care-actions/:action_id`, the response includes the reverted `updated_schedule` — update the care card status from it without re-fetching.
7. **AI years unit:** The AI endpoint may return `"repotting": { "frequency_unit": "years" }`. Convert to months (`* 12`) before persisting via `PUT /plants/:id`.

### Blockers

- None. Frontend Engineer may begin integration immediately once endpoints are implemented (implementation phase follows this contracts phase).

## H-003 — API Contracts for QA Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | H-003 |
| **From** | Backend Engineer |
| **To** | QA Engineer |
| **Date** | 2026-03-23 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Subject** | API contracts are published. QA Engineer may use them to plan integration test cases. |
| **Spec Refs** | T-008, T-009, T-010, T-011, T-012, T-013, T-014 |
| **Status** | Pending |

### Test Focus Areas for QA

| Area | Key Scenarios to Test | Task Ref |
|------|-----------------------|---------|
| **Auth — Register** | Happy path; duplicate email (409); short password (400); missing fields (400) | T-015 |
| **Auth — Login** | Happy path; wrong password (401); unknown email (401); missing fields (400) | T-015 |
| **Auth — Refresh** | Valid refresh → new tokens; expired token (401); already-rotated token (401) | T-015 |
| **Auth — Logout** | Valid logout; double-logout (second call should still 200 or 401 gracefully) | T-015 |
| **Plants — List** | Returns only current user's plants; empty list; pagination params; no token (401) | T-016 |
| **Plants — Create** | Happy path with schedules; missing name (400); duplicate care_type in schedules (400); no watering schedule (verify API allows it) | T-016 |
| **Plants — Get** | Happy path; 404 for nonexistent plant; 404 for another user's plant (ownership check) | T-016 |
| **Plants — Update** | Full replace of schedules; removing a schedule type; 404 for wrong user | T-016 |
| **Plants — Delete** | Cascades to schedules and care_actions; 404 for wrong user | T-016 |
| **Photo Upload** | Happy path JPEG/PNG/WebP; file too large (400); wrong type (400); no file (400) | T-016 |
| **AI Advice** | Text-only query; photo URL query; neither provided (400); mock/stub Gemini for CI | T-017 |
| **Care Actions — Create** | Happy path; wrong care_type (400); no schedule exists for care_type (422); future performed_at (400) | T-016 |
| **Care Actions — Delete (undo)** | Reverts schedule; action not found (404); action belongs to different plant (404) | T-016 |
| **Profile** | Returns correct plant count; correct care action total; days_as_member is correct | T-016 |
| **Schema / Migrations** | `knex migrate:up` succeeds; `knex migrate:down` fully rolls back; no orphaned rows | T-014 |

### Security Checks to Verify

- No user can access or mutate another user's plants, care schedules, or care actions (all scoped by `user_id`)
- Refresh token is stored as a hash (raw value never retrievable from DB)
- SQL injection: test parameterized queries hold against common payloads (check via `sqlmap` lite or manual tests)
- File upload: verify non-image files (e.g., `.exe`, `.php`) are rejected by MIME check (not just extension)
- JWT: tampered token (modified payload) returns 401

### Notes

- AI endpoint (`POST /ai/advice`) should be tested with a stub/mock Gemini response in CI to avoid real API costs and flakiness.
- See `security-checklist.md` for the full required security verification list.
