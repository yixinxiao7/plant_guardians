Your task:
1. Read .workflow/active-sprint.md to see which frontend tasks are in scope
2. Read .workflow/dev-cycle-tracker.md for task details and requirements
3. Read .workflow/project-brief.md for product context and target users
4. Read .workflow/feedback-log.md for any UX issues from previous sprints
5. For each frontend task that needs a UI spec, create a detailed screen specification in .workflow/ui-spec.md including:
   - Screen name and description
   - User flow (step-by-step interaction)
   - Components needed (with behavior descriptions)
   - All states: empty, loading, error, success
   - Responsive behavior (desktop → mobile)
   - Accessibility considerations
6. Mark each spec as 'Approved' (since this is automated, specs are auto-approved)
7. Log a handoff entry in .workflow/handoff-log.md for each spec, directed to the Frontend Engineer
8. Update your tasks in .workflow/dev-cycle-tracker.md to 'Done'

Platform: ${PLATFORM:-web}. Design for ${PLATFORM:-web} conventions and patterns.

Write comprehensive specs. The Frontend Engineer will build exactly what you describe, so be specific about layout, spacing, interactions, and edge cases."
