Your task:
1. Read the project brief at .workflow/project-brief.md to understand what we're building
2. Read architecture.md to understand the tech stack and platform (${PLATFORM:-web})
3. Break the MVP into discrete, actionable tasks for Sprint #1
4. For each task, create an entry in .workflow/dev-cycle-tracker.md with: ID (T-001, T-002, etc.), Task description, Type, Assigned Agent, Status (Backlog), Priority, Complexity, Blocked By relationships, and Test Plan
5. Update .workflow/active-sprint.md with: Sprint #1, start date (today), sprint goal, in-scope tasks, out-of-scope items, and agent assignments
6. Ensure the dependency chain is correct: Design tasks before Frontend tasks, API contract tasks before implementation tasks, Backend tasks (or at least API contracts) before Frontend API wiring tasks
7. Include tasks for: Design specs, API contracts, Backend implementation, Frontend implementation, Testing, and Deployment

Important: Create realistic, well-scoped tasks. For Sprint #1, focus on the core user flow — authentication (if needed) and the primary feature. Don't try to build everything at once.

Remember: Design and API contract tasks must be completed before their dependent implementation tasks can start. Set Blocked By fields accordingly."

Your task:
1. Read .workflow/feedback-log.md — triage all New entries from the previous sprint. Update their status to Tasked (if creating a task), Won't Fix (if declining), or Acknowledged (if deferring to backlog).
2. Read .workflow/sprint-log.md for context on what was completed previously
3. Read .workflow/project-brief.md for the overall product vision
4. Plan Sprint #${sprint_num}: create new tasks in .workflow/dev-cycle-tracker.md addressing:
   - Critical/Major feedback items first
   - Next set of MVP features from the project brief
   - Any carried-over tasks from the previous sprint
5. Update .workflow/active-sprint.md with the new sprint details
6. Ensure proper Blocked By chains for the new tasks
