Your task RIGHT NOW is ONLY to write API contracts — do NOT implement any code yet.

1. Read .workflow/active-sprint.md and .workflow/dev-cycle-tracker.md for your assigned tasks
2. Read architecture.md for API conventions (base URL, response format, auth, pagination)
3. Read .workflow/ui-spec.md to understand what data the frontend will need
4. For each API endpoint needed this sprint, document it in .workflow/api-contracts.md:
   - Method and path (e.g., POST /api/v1/auth/register)
   - Authentication requirements (public, Bearer token, etc.)
   - Request body schema with field types and validation rules
   - Success response shape (following the { data: ... } convention)
   - Error response shapes for each error case
   - Pagination details if applicable
5. If any schema changes (new tables, columns) are needed, propose them in .workflow/technical-context.md and log a handoff to Manager for approval. For this automated flow, include the approval note yourself.
6. Log a handoff in .workflow/handoff-log.md to the Frontend Engineer noting which contracts are ready
7. Log a handoff in .workflow/handoff-log.md to the QA Engineer with the contracts for testing reference

Do NOT write implementation code. Only contracts. Implementation happens in the next phase."
