Your task: Review all tasks currently in 'In Review' status.

1. Read .workflow/dev-cycle-tracker.md to find all tasks in 'In Review'
2. For each task in review:
   a. Read the code the engineer wrote (check backend/src/ and frontend/src/)
   b. Verify it follows the conventions in architecture.md and rules.md
   c. Check that API implementations match the contracts in .workflow/api-contracts.md
   d. Check that UI implementations match the specs in .workflow/ui-spec.md
   e. Verify tests exist (at least one happy-path and one error-path)
   f. Check for security issues: hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, missing auth checks
   g. Verify error handling is proper and doesn't leak internal details
3. For each task:
   - If the code is good: move the task to 'Integration Check' in dev-cycle-tracker.md
   - If the code needs changes: add review notes to the task's Notes field and move it back to 'In Progress'
4. Log handoffs in .workflow/handoff-log.md to QA Engineer for tasks that pass review
5. Log handoffs back to the responsible engineer for tasks that need changes

Be thorough but pragmatic. Focus on correctness, security, and convention adherence. Don't nitpick style if the code is functional and readable."
